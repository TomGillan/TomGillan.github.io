                    <p>As part of the fourth module of my MSc in UX Design, I&nbsp;designed a new product for third level students with disabilities using universal design principles. The project spanned four weeks (part-time) and comprised primary research, prototyping, and user&nbsp;testing.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>Because I was tasked with innovating a completely new product, research was critical. Methods included a call with support services from IADT, interviews with current and past students, reviewing a day in life youtube videos and online articles on disabled students experiences in&nbsp;university.
<br><br>
General frustrations experienced by students fell into six themes: exclusion and isolation, getting around, managing their schedule, empowerment, and accessing&nbsp;support.                   </p>

                    <h2>Selecting a product to develop</h2>
                    <p>The research made it clear that one of the largest problems was the people who need support but never had a needs assessment or didn't understand how support could help&nbsp;them.<br><br>

I narrowed my focus to designing a product to check how support could help them conveniently. From the point of view of the college and supports staff, if they were able to know the number of disabled students and what kinds of supports they required, the college could apply for funding to put in place suitable infrastructure in anticipation of student&nbsp;needs.<br><br>

To prototype the app, I needed to find a way of screening for disabilities that already existed and could be done remotely and&nbsp;unmoderated.<br><br>

The Wahington learning needs screening tool was used to screen students for the likelihood that they have a disability and would be eligible for learning&nbsp;supports.<br><br>

Central to the product is that it would alleviate students' burden of seeking out and securing&nbsp;supports.</p>
