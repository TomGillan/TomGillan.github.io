                    <p>Kara healthcare is a design concept completed for my Visual communications graduation show. The project speculates that advancements in health monitoring technology could allow for widespread use of mobile devices to accurately monitor and provide care advice to patients living with long term health conditions.<br><br>

The challenge was to design a whole new way of interacting with this technology to live fuller, happier lives without dealing with detailed&nbsp;data.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>There were ethical issues with me conducting in-&nbsp;depth research with people living with medical conditions as a student. However, I did have the opportunity to talk to a range of friends and family who have long-term health conditions. From that, I&nbsp;generated a series of proto-personas representing some of the experiences of the people that I managed&nbsp;to&nbsp;interview.</p>
