                    <p>As part of the first module of my MSc. in UX Design, I&nbsp;was worked in a group of three to improve an aspect of the Microsoft Teams app. The project spanned four weeks (part-time) and comprised of research testing and&nbsp;prototyping.</p>

                    <h2>Project management</h2>
                    <p>Although we had never met in person, we worked well as a team. Meetings were used to share findings, discuss designs, and plan for work for our next meeting. We used Miro to share research and discoveries from testing and Figma to share and collaborate on prototypes. The early research we did to establish personas and user needs helping us empathise with users and gave us a shared vision, ensuring that we worked effectively as a&nbsp;group.<br><br>
                    
                    General frustrations experienced by students fell into six themes: exclusion and isolation, getting around, managing their schedule, empowerment, and accessing&nbsp;support.

                    <h2>Research methods</h2>
                    <p>Research methods included investigating online reviews and conducting interviews and more generative techniques such as user experience mapping and&nbsp;personas.<br><br>
                        
                    Since the widespread movement towards remote work, We saw an opportunity to appeal to new app users, focusing our research on people who had started using Teams since the&nbsp;pandemic.
                    <br><br>
                    A heuristic evaluation was performed to identify issues in the app quickly. It became clear that two major pitfalls of the current design were accessing help and scheduling&nbsp;meetings.

                    <p>Online reviews highlighted issues in scheduling meetings, app notifications, and the level of support offered within the app. Because of time and budget, ad-hock recruitment was used to recruit for interviews. Users I interviewed found the app difficult and unintuitive to&nbsp;use.</p>
