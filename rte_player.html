                    <h5>Intro</h5>
                    <p>I worked in a group to redesign the RTÉ Player mobile app. The group members consisted of Áine, Michaela, Jaesin, Michael and myself. The project spanned 11 weeks (part-time). We did not have access to data or analytics that RTÉ’s internal team had, so our design was based purely upon the research we gathered throughout the&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <h2>Project management</h2>
                    <p>We worked hard to ensure team cohesion. We shared our work in live collaborative files, research in Miro and design in&nbsp;Figma.<br><br>
                    
                    We each worked individually and collectively, coming together to move the project forward and make key&nbsp;advancements.<br><br>
                        
                    General frustrations experienced by students fell into six themes: exclusion and isolation, getting around, managing their schedule, empowerment, and accessing&nbsp;support.

                    <h2>Research methods</h2>
                    <p>Our research approach was to quickly build empathy for users of the app through investigatiing online reviews, conducting user interviews and running a survey with open ended questions.<br><br>
Quantitative data was gathered by a survey and RTÉ viewership reports. Compeditor analysis was used to establish base user&nbsp;expectations.

                    <h2>Online reviews</h2>
                    <p>Reviews of RTÉ player made clear users’ frustrations with the current app. User’s utter contempt for the app bordered on comical. One user said that the RTÉ Player was “Hands down the worst app ever built.” General satisfaction was so low that people were deleting the&nbsp;app.<br><br>
                    
                    Users acknowledged the quality of the content on the app but were let down by the experience. The most frequent use of the app was to watch sport and&nbsp;boxsets.

                    <p>10 unstructured interviews were conducted the amount of qualitative data gathered. The interviews revealed that users streamed shows to relax resent the stress of trying to pick something to&nbsp;watch.<br><br> 
                    When users were tired, searching for something required too much effort to find something good to watch. Fresh content was something all users looked for, but users were loyal to a favourite show or topic that they consistently went back too. This, in turn, resulted in knock-on loyalty to the&nbsp;service.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis of the current app</h2>
                    <p>A heuristic analysis made it clear that usability was seriously lacking. There is a lack of clarity in the hierarchy of the app’s content. Genres, themes, series and individual episodes are all at the same level. Highlight snippets from various series compete with the main series, and there is no clear visual link between individual episodes, each of which has its own page. Pages such as browse and home play much the same role, and the search bar is hidden away in&nbsp;browse.<br><br>

There are issues with the apps information architecture. Many users interviewed were unaware of much of the apps’ quality&nbsp;content.<br><br> 

Another failing of the app is its inability to retain users. Many have used the app to watch popular series such as Normal People and Love Hate but discontinued use once they finished the series. A list of How Might We statements were created for ways to improve the&nbsp;app.</p>

                    <h2>Information architecture</h2>
                    <p>Early in the project, we realised the RTÉ Player app’s main shortcoming was users’ experience browsing the app and selecting what to watch. A content analysis was performed to allow us to redesign the apps information&nbsp;architecture.<br><br>

There was little difference between the existing design’s home and browse tab. We decided to combine home and browse and create a new tab Search for when a user had a specific show in mind. We identified the search function as an important and frequent activity and so moved it from the top bar to the bottom nav bar so that it was consistently and easily available to the&nbsp;user.</p>

                    <h2>User testing</h2>
                    <p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions, we ran remote moderated tests using participants’ computers. We needed to test how users would react to our redesign concept to gather data on how our design performed and made improvements. Our goals were&nbsp;to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Test natural use cases of the app and work with participants that represented our end-user&nbsp;group.<br><br></p></li>
                        <li><p>Develop a set of tasks and questions that would allow us to recover valuable qualitative and quantitative&nbsp;data.<br><br></p></li>
                        <li><p>Record participants behaviour and preferences to discover problem areas and opportunities to improve the&nbsp;design.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As it turned out, there weren’t many usability issues within our app, so we could quickly make changes based upon our testing.</p>
